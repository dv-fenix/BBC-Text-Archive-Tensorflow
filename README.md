# BBC Archive (Tensorflow in Practice Week 1)
Tokenizing and removing common stopwords from the BBC Text Archives

This repository is aimed at providing another method to solve the simplistic problem provided at the end of week 1 of the course.
I have included the use of the Pandas library, which as many already know is a novel technique to easily handle ".csv" files(which is the format that the BBC Archives have been made available).

The solution is presented in the Program.py file of the repository and, with minor modifications, can be applied to the users own specific use cases.

The stop-words were picked out from the following repostiory: "https://github.com/Yoast/YoastSEO.js/blob/develop/src/config/stopwords.js"
The BBC-Archive used in this example can be found here: "https://storage.googleapis.com/laurencemoroney-blog.appspot.com/bbc-text.csv"
